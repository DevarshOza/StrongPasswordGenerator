# StrongPasswordGenerator
I have created this tool because generating a password that is strong as well as easy to remember is a headach, In this tool it user your given keywords(for example your name, number, DOB) to create it to make it easy to remember and convert it into a strong password.
We can also generate a random strong password with it.
